## Case Study
Robin Hood
### What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?
RobinHood is an internet stock trading platform that offers unlimited commission free trading for stocks in U.S. public companies, ETF’s (exchange traded funds), Stock options, and Cryptocurrencies. Its competitors are Schwab or E*Trade.

### How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?
User friendly mobile application and non-physical market maker using technology.

### Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?
By studying RobinHood’s business model, students will learn a classic story of dot-com disruption. By studying RobinHood’s app, students will learn about how stock trading works: the different kinds of orders, what short selling is (and why RobinHood customers can’t do it), what clearing is, etc. By studying associated informational materials, such as the business news in “RobinHood Snacks,” students will learn about investing in general.
As stated above, one of the killer apps for the entire internet was on-line trading, and that hasn’t gone away. As a result, RobinHood is growing extremely fast. As of about 8 months ago, they had about 250 employees, but the Bloomberg Businessweek article states that “ RobinHood plans to add 150 backoffice and customer service employees to its Orlando operation, and hundreds more in Menlo Park.”
RobinHood also has significant competition, most notably CoinBase for cryptocurrency trading and lower prices from the more established players. All of these organizations are looking for talent.
### What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?
Certainly, there is much in financial services that is ripe for disruption. Why do average credit card interest rates hover at 14% per annum, for example, even though credit card providers also extract additional transaction fees from merchants? OK, these interest charges and fees must cover lots of credit card fraud, but the incumbents are not doing as much as they could to mitigate it (like eliminating the deluge of unsolicited credit card mail-in offerings that criminals can so easily use to generate phony accounts).
In any case, RobinHood’s demonstrated ability to provide extremely inexpensive financial services at scale suggests that it is a business to watch.
